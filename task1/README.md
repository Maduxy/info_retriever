 This is a FastAPI-based API that classifies a given integer by returning various properties such as:
- Whether the number is prime (using the `sympy` library)
- Whether the number is perfect (using the `sympy` library)
- The sum of its digits
- Its Armstrong property (if applicable)
- Its parity (even or odd)
- A fun math fact fetched from the [Numbers API](http://numbersapi.com)
